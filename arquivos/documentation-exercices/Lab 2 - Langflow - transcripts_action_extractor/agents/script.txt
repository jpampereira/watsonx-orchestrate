**[09:00:15] Sarah:** Okay everyone, let's officially kick off. The core Q3 review is actually solid. . Honestly, very good. We just have these, like, these weird loose ends.
**[09:01:22] Alice:** Uh, yeah. On the comms part, I was just thinking about that Q3 deck. So, uh, I'm taking the lead on the client update. We're good there. Alice to send the Q3 deck by Friday. I mean, that's what I said before, but yeah, it's firm.
**[09:02:40] Mark:** Yeah, and I know Bob, you're slammed, but what's the ETA on the new API documentation? That's kinda our bottleneck now.
**[09:03:01] Bob:** Uh-huh. Bob will review the API docs tomorrow. Yeah, that's completely locked in. I just need a clean four hours for the final check. Oh, and John, are you on the call?
**[09:03:55] John:** (unintelligible) Yeah, I'm here. Customer call. Yes. John: I'm speaking with the customer by 10/12. We can move that out of the blocker list.
**[09:04:30] Sarah:** Fantastic, okay. So John's clear. Now, the public announcement, let's not let that slip. We need to get the statement ready. Draft the announcement before Oct 15 so Legal has, like, you know, a full week.
**[09:05:15] Mark:** And one other thing, admin stuff, but critical. Site visits are coming up fast. We should also book rooms next week for the new candidates. I'll flag that in a separate chat right after this.
**[09:06:05] Sarah:** Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the clarity on those dates. Let's sync up again. Bye.
